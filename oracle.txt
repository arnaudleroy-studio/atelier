THE ORACLE // SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE v1.3 [Golden Master]
================================================================================
"Silence is a Material."
A computational divination tool designed to break executive dysfunction.

[ 01 ] THE VELOCITY ENGINE (The Rage Sensor)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
> THE MECHANIC:
  The app listens to the accelerometer (G-Force). It distinguishes between a 
  gentle oscillation (Calm Shake) and a violent impulse (Rage Shake).
  - Soft Shake (< 2.5 G): Returns soothing advice ("breathe.", "patience.").
  - Hard Shake (> 2.5 G): Returns aggressive commands ("do it.", "wake up.").
> THE PSYCHOLOGY:
  Traditional apps ignore the user's physical state. The Oracle acknowledges 
  frustration. If you shake it in anger, it matches your energy with urgency.
> THE CODE:
  Uses Apple's `CoreMotion` framework. Calculates the square root of the sum 
  of squares (vector magnitude) of X, Y, Z axes to determine total force.

[ 02 ] THE BLACKOUT TIMER (Enforced Reflection)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
> THE MECHANIC:
  Immediately after delivering a strategy, the interface "dies." The screen 
  fades to absolute black for 10 seconds. Touch interaction is disabled.
> THE PSYCHOLOGY:
  Creatives are "dopamine loopers"—we re-roll dice until we get an easy answer. 
  The Blackout removes the slot-machine effect. It forces the user to sit 
  in the void with the answer they were given, preventing avoidance behaviors.
> THE CODE:
  A `ZStack` black overlay triggered via `DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter`. 
  Locks the UI thread interaction logic during the duration.

[ 03 ] THE HAPTIC METRONOME (Somatic Anchor)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
> THE MECHANIC:
  If the strategy "inhale。 exhale。 repeat。" is selected, the Taptic Engine 
  begins to pulse at 60 BPM (resting heart rate).
> THE PSYCHOLOGY:
  Anxiety accelerates the heart rate. By holding a device that physically 
  beats at a calm rhythm, the user's nervous system instinctively attempts 
  to entrain (sync) with the slower tempo. It is biofeedback without a screen.
> THE CODE:
  A `Timer` firing `UIImpactFeedbackGenerator(style: .soft)` every 1.0 seconds.

[ 04 ] THE CIRCADIAN GUARD (Midnight Protocol)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
> THE MECHANIC:
  If the app is opened between 02:00 AM and 05:00 AM, the randomization 
  engine is disabled. It returns only one message: "go to sleep。".
> THE PSYCHOLOGY:
  Nothing good is created at 4 AM by an exhausted mind. The app transitions 
  from a tool of production to a guardian of health. It rejects the toxic 
  "hustle culture" that demands 24/7 output.
> THE CODE:
  `Calendar.current.component(.hour)` check inserted before the Deck Logic.

[ 05 ] THE ANTI-STREAK (Negative Gamification)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
> THE MECHANIC:
  Instead of celebrating "Daily Streaks" (which induce anxiety to maintain), 
  the app tracks "Days Since Last Consultation."
  Footer reads: "3 days since last consultation。 good。"
> THE PSYCHOLOGY:
  The goal of a tool is to NOT need the tool. We reward independence. 
  If you haven't asked the Oracle in a week, you are doing the work. 
  That is success.
> THE CODE:
  `UserDefaults` stores a simple Timestamp. Logic calculates the `DateComponents` 
  delta on app launch.

[ 06 ] THE SYSTEM ANOMALY (The Glitch)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
> THE MECHANIC:
  There is a 0.2% (1 in 500) chance that a shake triggers a "System Failure." 
  The background flashes Red, and the text reads "none of this matters。"
> THE PSYCHOLOGY:
  It introduces myth and rarity. It reminds the user that the system is 
  fallible, breaking the seriousness of the creative block. It serves as a 
  digital "Memento Mori."
> THE CODE:
  `Int.random(in: 0...500) == 0`. Overrides all other logic branches.
